# Renaissance Adaptive Learning Agent (POC)

This repository contains the Streamlit proof-of-concept that I built for the **Renaissance EdTech Platform** and submitted to the **MKTBA Hackathon – Fall 2025**. It showcases an **AI adaptive learning agent** that guides Business Analytics and Marketing learners through a branded experience inspired by Renaissance’s design language.

> ⚠️ **POC disclaimer:** This codebase is shared for educational purposes. It is not a production-ready product—there is no backend, vector database, or external orchestration. Everything runs locally inside Streamlit and JSON file for memort to demonstrate the concept quickly.

## What’s Included

- **Renaissance-themed UI flow**: landing, onboarding, roadmap selection, and a Data Engineer roadmap page (only the Business Analytics → Data Engineer branch is interactive today).
- **Adaptive AI Tutor panel**: lightweight OpenAI-powered interaction with a mock analytics log.
- **Learning analytics panel**: derives insights from sample tutor events stored on disk.
- **Self-contained assets**: logos, hero images, and profile art required for the demo.

## Run It Locally

1. **Install Python 3.9+**
2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Add your OpenAI key (optional but recommended for the tutor panel)**
   ```env
   # .env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key
   ```
4. **Launch Streamlit**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app/main_app.py
   ```

The entire experience runs offline except for OpenAI calls. No databases or third-party services are required to recreate the demo.

```

- `app/data/tutor_events.json` contains pre-populated tutor logs so the analytics tab renders immediately; delete it to reset.
- `assets/` holds all Renaissance-branded visuals referenced by the pages.

## Tips for Remixing

- Swap out logos or imagery by replacing files inside `assets/`.
- Adjust roadmap content or copy within the corresponding file in `app/pages/`.
- Extend the tutor or analytics experiences inside `app/components/`; both modules are decoupled from external services.
- If you add other roadmaps, update the state machine in `app/main_app.py`; right now only the Business Analytics → Data Engineer path is wired end-to-end.
